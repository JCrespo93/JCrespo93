# Hi, I'm Jesús 👋 👨‍💻 🧑‍🏫

I am a hardware engineer passionate about spreading computer science knowledge to others. Since 2020, I work as a teacher in the education sector, seeking to bring knowledge in an enjoyable and professional way to my students.

I seek to contribute and help the educational community with explanations, examples and practical exercises using open source. Currently, I am teaching the basics of frontend using technologies such as HTML, CSS, JS and Git to lay the foundations of client development in my students.
